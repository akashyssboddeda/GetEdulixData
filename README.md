# GetEdulixData
Use this file to fetch data to a spreadsheet from edulix.com
You will have to look for "CHANGE::", read the comment and change it accordingly and you are good to go.

Basically all you need to do is 

1. write the URL of the college from edulix and the file name

2. choose if you want the admit data or the rejected data

3. choose a file location to save the file.

Let me know how it goes and keep smiling. :)
